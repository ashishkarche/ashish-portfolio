          <p>
            Hi! I'm Ashish Vikas Karche, a passionate software developer with a strong background in web development. 
            I specialize in creating modern, responsive websites and applications using technologies like React, Node.js, 
            and Express. My goal is to craft intuitive, user-centered digital experiences that make a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or 
            learning new skills. Iâ€™m always looking for exciting projects and collaborations that challenge me to grow.
          </p>
